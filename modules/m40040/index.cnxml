      <title>Conductors and insulators</title>
      <para id="id201248">All atoms are electrically neutral i.e. they have the same amounts of negative and positive
charge inside them. By convention, the electrons carry negative charge and the protons carry
positive charge.
The basic unit of charge, called the elementary charge, <emphasis effect="italics">e</emphasis>, is
the amount of charge carried by one electron.</para>
      <para id="id201259">All the matter and materials on earth are made up of atoms.
Some materials allow electrons to move relatively freely
through them (e.g. most metals, the human body).
These materials are called <emphasis effect="bold">conductors</emphasis>.</para>
      <para id="id201271">Other materials do not allow the charge carriers, the electrons, to move
through them (e.g. plastic, glass).
The electrons are bound to the atoms in the material. These materials are called
<emphasis effect="bold">non-conductors</emphasis> or <emphasis effect="bold">insulators</emphasis>.</para>
      <para id="id201289">If an excess of charge is placed on an insulator, it will stay
where it is put and there will be a concentration of charge in
that area of the object. However, if an excess of charge is placed
on a conductor, the like charges will repel each other
and spread out over the outside surface of the object. When two conductors
are made to touch, the total charge on them is shared between the
two. If the two conductors are identical, then each conductor will
be left with half of the total charge.</para>
<note id="eip-509" type="aside"><title>Charge and electrons</title>The basic unit of charge, namely the
elementary charge is carried by the
electron (equal to 1.602<m:math overflow="scroll"><m:mrow><m:mo>Ã—</m:mo><m:msup><m:mn>10</m:mn><m:mrow><m:mo>-</m:mo><m:mn>19</m:mn></m:mrow></m:msup></m:mrow></m:math> C!). In a conducting material (e.g. copper), when the atoms
bond to form the material, some of the outermost, loosely bound
electrons become detached from the individual atoms and so become
free to move around. The charge carried by these electrons can
move around in the material. In insulators, there are very few, if
any, free electrons and so the charge cannot move around in the
material. </note><note id="eip-841"><title>Interesting fact</title>In 1909 Robert Millikan and Harvey Fletcher measured the charge on an electron. This experiment is now known as Millikan's oil drop experiment. Millikan and Fletcher sprayed oil droplets into the space between two charged plates and used what they knew about forces and in particular the electric force to determine the charge on an electron.</note>

        <title>The electroscope</title>
        <para id="id201715">The electroscope is a very sensitive instrument which can be used to detect electric charge.
A diagram of a gold leaf electroscope is shown the figure below. The electroscope consists of a glass container
with a metal rod inside which has 2 thin pieces of gold foil attached. The other end of the metal rod has a metal plate attached to it outside the glass container.</para>
        <para id="id200543">
          <figure id="id200546">
            <media id="id200546_media" alt="">

            </media>
          </figure>
        </para>
        <para id="id200552">The electroscope detects charge in the following way: A charged object, like the positively charged rod in the picture, is brought close to (but not touching) the neutral metal plate of the electroscope. This causes negative charge in the gold foil, metal rod, and metal plate, to be attracted to the positive rod. Because the metal (gold is a metal too!) is a conductor, the charge can move freely from the foil up the metal rod and onto the metal plate. There is now more negative charge on the plate and more positive charge on the gold foil leaves. This is called <emphasis effect="italics">inducing</emphasis> a charge on the metal plate. It is important to remember that the electroscope is still neutral (the total positive and negative charges are the same), the charges have just been induced to <emphasis effect="italics">move</emphasis> to different parts of the instrument! The induced positive charge on the gold leaves forces them apart since like charges repel! This is how we can tell that the rod is charged. If the rod is now moved away from the metal plate, the charge in the electroscope will spread itself out evenly again and the leaves will fall down because there will no longer be an induced charge on them.</para>
        <section id="uid12">
          <title>Grounding</title>
          <para id="id200585">If you were to bring the charged rod close to the uncharged electroscope, and then you touched the metal plate with your finger at the same time, this would cause charge to flow up from the ground (the earth), through your body onto the metal plate. Connecting to the earth so charge flows is called <emphasis effect="bold">grounding</emphasis>. The charge flowing onto the plate is opposite to the charge on the rod, since it is attracted to the charge on the rod. Therefore, for our picture, the charge flowing onto the plate would be negative. Now that charge has been added to the electroscope, it is no longer neutral, but has an excess of negative charge. Now if we move the rod away, the leaves will remain apart because they have an excess of negative charge and they repel each other. If we ground the electroscope again (this time without the charged rod nearby), the excess charge will flow back into the earth, leaving it neutral.</para>

        <title>Polarisation of Insulators</title>
        <para id="id201876">Unlike conductors, the electrons in insulators (non-conductors) are bound to the atoms of the
insulator and cannot move around freely through the material. However, a charged object can still
exert a force on a neutral insulator due to a phenomenon called <emphasis effect="bold">polarisation</emphasis>.</para>
        <para id="id201887">If a positively charged rod is
brought close to a neutral insulator such as polystyrene, it can attract the bound electrons
to move round to the
side of the atoms which is closest to the rod and cause the positive nuclei to move slightly
to the opposite side of the atoms. This process is called <emphasis effect="italics">polarisation</emphasis>. Although
it is a very small (microscopic) effect, if there are many atoms and the polarised object is
light (e.g. a small polystyrene ball), it can add up to enough force to cause the object to be attracted onto the
charged rod. Remember, that the polystyrene
is <emphasis effect="italics">only</emphasis> polarised, <emphasis effect="italics">not charged.</emphasis>
The polystyrene ball is still neutral since no charge was added or removed from it.
The picture shows
a not-to-scale view of the polarised atoms in the polystyrene ball:</para>

        </para>
        <para id="id201923">Some materials are made up of molecules which are already polarised.
These are molecules which have
a more positive and a more negative side but are still neutral overall.
Just as a polarised polystyrene ball can be attracted to a charged rod, these materials
are also affected if brought close to a charged object.</para>
        <para id="id201929">Water is an example of a substance which is made of polarised molecules.
If a positively charged rod is brought close to a stream of water, the molecules can rotate
so that the negative sides all line up towards the rod.
The stream of water will then be attracted to the rod since opposite charges attract.</para>
