      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para id="id127925">Magnetism is a force that certain kinds of objects, which are called `magnetic' objects, can exert on each other without physically touching. A magnetic object is surrounded by a magnetic `field' that gets weaker as one moves further away from the object. A second object can feel a magnetic force from the first object because it feels the magnetic field of the first object.</para>
      <para id="id127932">Humans have known about magnetism for many thousands of years.
For example, <emphasis effect="italics">lodestone</emphasis> is a magnetised form of the iron oxide mineral
<emphasis effect="italics">magnetite</emphasis>. It has the property of attracting iron
objects. It is referred to in old European and Asian historical
records; from around 800 <emphasis effect="smallcaps">BCE</emphasis> in Europe and around
2Â 600 <emphasis effect="smallcaps">BCE</emphasis> in Asia.</para>
<note id="notfhsst_id81"><title> Interesting Fact </title>
      <para id="id128302">The root of the English word <emphasis effect="italics">magnet</emphasis> is from the Greek word <emphasis effect="italics">magnes</emphasis>, probably from Magnesia in Asia Minor, once an important source of lodestone.</para>

      <title>Magnetic fields</title>
      <para id="id128332">A magnetic field is a region in space where a magnet or object made of magnetic material will experience a non-contact force.</para>
      <para id="id128337">Electrons inside any object have magnetic fields associated
with them. In most materials these fields point in all
directions, so the net magnetic field is zero. For example, in the plastic ball below,
the directions of the magnetic fields of the electrons (shown by the arrows) are pointing
in different directions and cancel each other out. Therefore the plastic ball is not magnetic and
has no magnetic field.</para>

      <para id="id128355">In some materials (e.g. iron), called <emphasis effect="bold">ferromagnetic</emphasis> materials, there are regions called <emphasis effect="italics">domains</emphasis>, where the electrons' magnetic fields line up with each other. All the atoms in each domain are grouped together so that the magnetic fields from their electrons point the same way. The picture shows a piece of an iron needle zoomed in to show the domains with the electric fields lined up inside them.</para>

      <para id="id128380">In permanent magnets, many domains are lined up, resulting in a <emphasis effect="italics">net magnetic field</emphasis>.
Objects made from ferromagnetic materials can be magnetised, for example by rubbing a magnet
along the object in one direction. This causes the magnetic fields of most, or all, of the domains to line up in one direction. As a result the object as a whole will have a net magnetic field. It is <emphasis effect="italics">magnetic</emphasis>. Once a ferromagnetic object has been magnetised, it can stay magnetic without another magnet being nearby (i.e. without being in another magnetic field). In the picture below, the needle has been magnetised because the magnetic fields in all the domains are pointing in the same direction.</para>
